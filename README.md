## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

List of applications that I like:
- Canvas Student: I like this due to it offering a To-Do list with helps me keep track of my assignment. Also, the dashboard layout with the grades on the top left corner makes it easier for me to keep my grade in a perticular class without opening the course.
- Passwords: I like this as the application allows me to directly access my saved passwords without opening up Settings and navigating through the sub-categories. Additionally, I like how the application categorizes my passowords by type. 
- Camera: I like this app because it is very minimal with a large circle in the middle to capture or record and the slider to change between camera modes. Also, I like how the 0.5x and 1x options are just within reach to quickly swap between the main and wide angle camera lenses.

App Idea:
- I am thinking a more advanced reminder app. In this app, I could list the courses that I am taking in the Semester. Once I click on a specific course, I could add assignments with their due date and marks. This way I would be reminded of the course and I could enter the score of what I recieved to get a better estimate of what I need to recieve in the upcoming assignments. This is some thing I would personally find extremely useful.

## Notes

Challenges:
- I had trouble adding my iPhone to xCode in order to run my project. I kept recieving an error but after a few adjustments, I was able to sucessfully add the app to my phone.
